<h1>Video & Data Processing</h1>
  <h2> Quick Necessary Info</h2>
    <h4>
     In this section you will hear the term Mother Board thrown around a lot. A motherboard or MOBO is the largest and one of the most important
    components in a computer system. The motherboard connects the GPU, CPU, and RAM together without wires and has ports for any wires leading to USB ports, Hard Drives, and other neccesities.

    <h2>CPU - The "Brain" of the Computer </h2>
      <p>
        Without processing, a computer really isn't a computer as there main function is to process and compute data.
        In order to be able to process Data, computers have a CPU or a Central Processing Unit. One can think of the CPU
        as the brain of the computer as everything is processed by it. The CPU performs basic logical, arithmetic and input/output operations that control programs at up to a billion operations per second.
        In some cases, a CPU may also compute graphical data so that it can be displayed to the monitor or choice of display.
      </p>
    <h2>The GPU</h2>
      <p>
        The Graphics Processing Unit is the module found in a computer that takes the appropriate data and outputs it to a monitor.
        Most modern day systems may not have a GPU as most CPUs have the ability to output an image to a monitor throug the monitor,
        however, if the user of the computer wants more graphical processing power (ie. Render better graphics) then they may use a GPU.
